    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "There is a widespread sense that affordable housing for the middle incomes households is under pressure. Especially for new entrants to the housing markets (i.e. those who do not yet own a house), affordable houses to buy in pleasant neighboorhoods are in short supply. Entrants to the housing market typically are people in their 20s and 30s.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The municipality of Amsterdam would like to tackle this issue. (see https://openresearch.amsterdam/en/page/77950/housing-crisis for articles on the subject). However, at present, the municipality of Amsterdam lacks insights on the future evolution of real-estate prices and liveability in neighborhoods. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your are asked to assist the municipality of Amsterdam in predicting **where** and **how** real-estate prices and liveability will change in the coming years.*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have access to four data sets:\n",
    "1. Real-estate prices in Amsterdam, at a 100x100m square grid level\n",
    "1. Liveability scores in the Netherlands, at a 100x100m square grid level\n",
    "1. Population statistics in Amsterdam, at a 100x100m square grid level\n",
    "1. Geographical boundaries of the 100x100m squares in Amsterdam\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Notes**\n",
    "- In the liveability scores dataset the column *versie* show the different versions of the livability score, we only use the 3rd version. Thus, you may filter this column to keep *Leefbaarometer 3.0*\tonly.\n",
    "- You may assume that the population statistics and geospatial data have not substantially changed across the years 2014 and 2020. Thus, you may assume both apply to 2014 and 2020.\n",
    "- For population statistics (3rd dataset), [this document](./data/demog_data/metadata.csv) provides a brief explanation of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tasks and grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assigment is divided into 3 subtasks: (1) Data preparation, (2) Data exploration and (3) Assess the affordability of 'liveable' neighbourhoods. In total, 10 points can be earned in this assignment. The weight per subtask is shown below. \n",

    "    1. What are the spatial trends for the evolution of the real-estate price and the liveability index? Do you observe some relationship between the two variables?\n",
